<h1>Abstract</h1>


Early onset Parkinson's prediction is often difficult to diagnose. But a comprehensive prediction model is difficult to achieve due to the limitation on data. In this paper we use the Parkinson's Telemonitoring data that records the progression of early onset Parkinson's for analysis and use it to create a robust prediction model via Decision Tree regression model. Here we use MAE as the predictor of performance. We reduce the target feature to total_UPDRS and remove Motor.
