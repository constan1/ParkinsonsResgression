<h1>Abstract</h1>


Early onset Parkinson's prediction is often difficult to diagnose and is often diagnosed with PET scans and presence of early onset symptoms. But a comprehensive prediction model is difficult to achieve due to the limitation on data. In this paper we use the Parkinson's Telemonitoring data that records the progression of early onset Parkinson's for analysis and to create a robust prediction model via Decision Tree regression model.
